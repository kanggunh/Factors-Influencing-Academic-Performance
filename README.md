### Factors Influencing Academic Performance

This analysis investigates the various factors that influence the average grades received by students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Specifically, we aim to identify and quantify the impact of variables such as class size, enrollment numbers, evaluation rates, recommendation rates, study hours, and departmental differences on the average grades. By constructing and analyzing multiple regression models, we seek to uncover the relationships between these predictors and the students' academic performance as measured by their grades.
